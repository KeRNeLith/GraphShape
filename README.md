# GraphShape

## What is **GraphShape**?

**GraphShape** is a .NET library that mainly provide graph layout framework.
It contains several overlap removal and layout algorithms that allow various kind of layouts and has also a module with customizable controls for WPF applications visualization.

Based on the [GraphSharp](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=graphsharp) library, it has be reworked add some improvements to it.

Main features:
- Several layout algorithms (FR, KK, ISOM, LinLog, Simple Tree, Circular, Sugiyama, Compound FDP, Random).
- Overlap removal algorithms (FSA or One Way FSA).
- Customizable WPF controls for visualization.
